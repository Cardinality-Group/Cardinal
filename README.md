# Cardinal Client (Î± 1.0)
cardinal client is a actively in development "all in one" client designed with the goal of creating a premium experience with a free and open source client. The client has 3 planned stages of development, and is currently only in its infancy.

The first stage, known as alpha, will involve on my end figuring out how to actually make a client, as I have little experience with minecraft, and I will first release a bare bones client with minimal modules and a half completed but functional gui, and then add on this until the gui is completed and it has modules equivalent to those you would expect in a PvP client. 

The second stage, or beta, will involve first integrating already made open source modules such as those found on liquidbounce and wurst, which will serve as functional placeholders until the gamma stage, and in the meantime, barritone, sodium, shaders, and fps optimizations will be baked into the game, and once I have completed these the client will move to the gamma stage of development. 

The third stage, or gamma, will involve slowly replacing the placeholder hacks from the beta step with those of my own design, and then splitting the client in 3, creating a PvP, ghost, and hacked client, all in one, and creating specially made original features to the ghost client, at which point the client will move to the release stage. 

When the client reaches the release stage, it will have been practically completed but will be regularly updated with patches and such.
